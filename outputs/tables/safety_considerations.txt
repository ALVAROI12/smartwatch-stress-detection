1. False Negatives: Missing critical stress events could delay intervention
   - Mitigation: Conservative thresholds, alert on uncertainty

2. False Positives: Unnecessary alerts may cause anxiety or alert fatigue
   - Mitigation: Confirmation window, trend analysis, user feedback

3. Privacy: Continuous physiological monitoring raises data concerns
   - Mitigation: On-device processing, no raw data transmission

4. Over-reliance: Users may depend solely on device for health decisions
   - Mitigation: Clear disclaimers, encourage professional consultation

5. Battery Drain: Continuous monitoring affects device usability
   - Mitigation: Efficient model, configurable monitoring frequency
